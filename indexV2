	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! This website, currently, looks absolutely awful, but welcome regardless. The purpose of this website is, in short,
	 shameless showing off. On this website you'll be able to find things like demonstrations and notes on my
	 various projects, discussions on various information technology and security concepts, and other info tech concepts. So welcome!
	 Make sure and take a look around.</p>

	<h2>My education goals</h2>
	&nbsp;
	<p>My goals for my education are, in short, to both grow and explore in the field of information security through improving my skills,
		and to attain a degree and/or high level certification in both programming and networking. I am already working to achieve these goals through
		tech prep programs, working with various technologies outside of school, and help from my teachers. As a rough estimate,
		I believe I'll be able to achieve these goals within as little as five years from now (February 2016).</p>

	<h2>My employment goal</h2>
	&nbsp;
	<p>My goal for employment, is someday to become employed as a whitehat hacker or penetration tester with a company like Raytheon.
		The skills I'm already beggining to learn, combined with the knowledge base being provided to me and expanded on by my
		instructors, will both go a long way towards building a useful foundation in the field. I hope to have achieved this goal within a few years of having
		finished my college education, if not before then.</p>
