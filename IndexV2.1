	<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>Welcome to my website! This website, currently, looks absolutely awful, but welcome regardless. The purpose of this website is, in short,
	 shameless showing off. On this website you'll be able to find things like demonstrations and notes on my
	 various projects, discussions on various information technology and security concepts, and other info tech concepts. So welcome!
	 Make sure and take a look around.</p>

	<h2>My education goals</h2>
	<!-- &nbsp; -->
	<p>My goals for my education are; first, to obtain an associates degree in Information Security from Sinclair by summer of 2019, 
		and second, to obtain a masters degree on the same subject from either the University of Cincinnati, or the University of Maryland by the end of 2023.
		I am already working to achieve these goals through tech prep programs, working with various technologies outside of school, 
		and help from my teachers. These two degrees will help immeasurably in reaching my employment goals, and will be instrumental to increasing my ability in the field.
		I'd also like to go for the 312-50 Ethical Hacker Certification. I believe I'll be able to achieve this by the end of 2020.</p>

	<h2>My employment goal</h2>
	<!-- &nbsp; -->
	<p>My goal for employment, is someday to become employed as a whitehat hacker or penetration tester with a company like Raytheon.
		The skills I'm already beggining to learn, combined with the knowledge base being provided to me and expanded on by my
		instructors, will both go a long way towards building a useful foundation in the field. I hope to have achieved this goal within a few years of having
		finished my college education, if not before then.</p>
